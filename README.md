## General info

Santa's list. This project is a simple back-end application that allows you to add new children to the Santa's list as well as gifts and their quantity. It was created mostly as back-end application so styles are VERY poor. The program uses a many-to-many database. You can assign a given gift to different children, and you will get a notification when the number of assigned gifts exceeds their available number.
## Technologies
Project uses:
* Express.js
* Express Handlebars
* MariaDB database

## Sources
This app is inspired by my Javascript mentor Jakób Król
